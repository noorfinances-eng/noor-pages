# NOOR (NUR) — “FINMA Light” Summary Sheet (Switzerland) — Internal Version

**Date:** November 9, 2025  
**Official Contact:** noorfinances@gmail.com  
**Network:** BNB Smart Chain (BSC, Chain ID 56)

## 1) Executive Summary
NOOR (NUR) is an **internal utility and payment token** deployed on BSC.  
The project provides **no yield**, **no direct fiat conversion**, and **no custody services**.  
It is intended for internal use (peer-to-peer payments, symbolic staking, “Proof of Light” missions).

## 2) Token Classification
- **Type:** Utility + Internal Payment Token  
- **Core Functions:**
  - P2P payments of small value between users/affiliates (no fiat).  
  - Symbolic access and benefits (e.g. Proof of Light actions).  
  - Non-financial staking (commitment and internal distribution only).  
- **What NOOR is *not*:**
  - Not a **security token** (no equity, debt, or profit rights).  
  - Not a **collective investment product**.  
  - Not a **public investment offering** (no ICO/IDO).

## 3) Usage Model (Internal)
- **Payments:** NUR ↔ NUR exchanges within the ecosystem (internal merchants/community).  
- **Staking:** purely symbolic — no promised or expected financial yield.  
- **Proof of Light:** allocation of NUR for transparent, positive community actions.  
- **No public sale against fiat** (CHF/EUR/USD). Any conversions are handled only via **regulated partner PSPs** (e.g. Mt Pelerin, NOWPayments).

## 4) No Yield / No Custody
- **No guaranteed return** (no yield, dividend, or interest).  
- **Zero custody:** users hold their own wallets and private keys.  
- **No intermediation:** smart contracts only; no custody of third-party funds.

## 5) “Legal Light” Framework (Switzerland)
- NOOR operates **without FINMA/OAR registration** as long as:
  - It performs **no fiat conversions** itself.  
  - It holds **no user funds**.  
  - It makes **no investment promises**.
- **Fiat conversions**: handled solely by **licensed partners (PSPs)** under their AML/KYC obligations.  
- **Communication**: focuses on transparency and utility, not on investment.

## 6) Governance & Responsibility
- **Founder/Owner:** 0x2538398B396bd16370aFBDaF42D09e637a86C3AC  
- **Contracts:**
  - Token (NOORTokenV2): `0xA20212290866C8A804a89218c8572F28C507b401`
  - Staking V3: `0x4eBAbfb635A865EEA2a5304E1444B125aE223f70`
  - Legacy Staking V2: `0x6CB5CBEc7F0c5870781eA467244Ed31e2Ea3c702`
- **Founder vesting:** ~25 % linearly over **24 months** (long-term alignment, no public sale obligation).  
- **Transparency:** public code, verified contracts, GitHub documentation, legal notices online.

## 7) Risk Disclosure
- **Volatility:** token price may fluctuate heavily (low liquidity at start).  
- **Technical risks:** bugs, network instability, wallet compatibility.  
- **User risks:** private key loss, address mistakes, irreversible transfers.  
- **Market risks:** thin order book, slippage on DEX swaps.  
- **Regulatory risks:** possible future changes in Swiss classification; NOOR commits to adjust accordingly.

## 8) Operational Compliance
- **KYC/AML:** not applicable at project level (no fiat, no custody). PSP partners perform their own AML checks.  
- **Data protection:** minimal collection, no sensitive data stored on-chain.  
- **Transparency:** all transactions visible on BscScan; documentation available on GitHub.

## 9) Public Communication Guidelines
- Never promise profit or ROI.  
- Emphasize **utility**, **ethical use**, and **transparency**.  
- Clarify user **self-custody** responsibility.  
- Refer any fiat conversion to partner PSPs only.

## 10) Project References
- **Website:** Next.js + Tailwind (Vercel) — multilingual (FR/EN/DE).  
- **Core pages:** /pay (QR + EIP-681), /merchant (merchant kit), /legal (notices).
